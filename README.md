# SparkinLumberJack
This script automates lumberjacking in Ultima Online, allowing you to chop trees, convert logs to boards (optional), and store resources in Up To  (5) Five pack beetles. It includes a safety net for detecting nearby players or invulnerable entities and a feature to walk 10 tiles in a random direction when no trees are found.
